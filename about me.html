       <h2>Welcome friends to my story corner </h2> 
       <h3> Let's start at the present</h3>
       <p>  I am a Manhattan born and Jersey bread graphic designer, artist and content creator. I enjoy organizing so much "The Home Edit" TV show along with anything involving home improvement fascinates me. <br>
        I have helped many small businesses get their social media  off the ground with promotional videos and materials. When I was in college designing and typography were still done by hand and I am proud to have those drawing skills. <br><br>
        I am known as Candice Artist to my close friends. My medium takes many forms in painting, music, and currently food. Cooking is a great way to show affection and a greater way to keep good company.<br><br>
       Growing up my whole reason for being was finding my companion. I filled notbooks of songs and sonnets of my search and failures. I even painted how it felt when it eluded me. Love found me later than I'd hoped 
        but right on time. I said "I do" to a man, who is very much my compliment, on a cold day in May during the year 2019. We live in an apartment overlooking 
        a frequently foul smelling marsh that feeds the lantern flies, turtles, many sparrows and baby bunnies. <br><br>When I was twenty one a small independent record label realeased a single of mine called "Set it on fire". I don't sing anymore,but would you like to hear it? I have it for you just below.
